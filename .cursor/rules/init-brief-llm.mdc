# Project Context Initialization

Provides an LLM session with essential project context using repomix for comprehensive codebase analysis.

When starting a new chat session or when an LLM needs project context:

## Primary Method: Repomix Analysis

1. **Generate Fresh Project Context**:
   - Clean any existing temp files: `Remove-Item -Path "temp/project-context.md" -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue`
   - Run repomix to generate comprehensive project overview: `repomix --compress -o temp/project-context.md --style markdown --no-git-sort-by-changes .`
   - Read the generated `temp/project-context.md` file completely

2. **Context Understanding**:
   - The repomix output includes:
     - Complete directory structure
     - All source files with full content
     - File summary with top files by size/importance
     - Security analysis
   - Focus on understanding the project's architecture, main components, and data flow

## Fallback Method (if repomix fails):

1. **Manual Project Overview**:
   - Read all MD files in project root for high-level description and objectives
   - Read other root files (package.json, etc.)

2. **Technical Stack & Structure**:
   - View package.json for dependencies and scripts
   - Read subfolders recursively to understand source file organization
   - Read core source files to understand main functionality

## Output Management:
- Always save repomix output to `temp/` directory to avoid cluttering project
- Never reuse old repomix outputs - always generate fresh analysis
- Clean up temp files when session ends if needed
