When asked to deploy a repository to Vercel, follow this CLI workflow:

1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Run `vercel --yes` to deploy (use `--name project-name-lowercase` if the project name contains uppercase or special characters).
3. Run `vercel git connect` to link the GitHub repository for automatic deployments.
4. Run `vercel --prod` to ensure a production deployment.
5. Run `vercel project ls` to obtain the final public URL.
6. Update the GitHub repository description with the live demo link using:
   `gh repo edit owner/repo --description "Description - Live demo: https://url"`
7. Provide the clickable public URL as the final output.

This workflow establishes a fully connected GitHub â†’ Vercel pipeline with automatic deployments on every push.

Always use the existing `VERCEL_TOKEN` environment variable (no additional authentication needed).
