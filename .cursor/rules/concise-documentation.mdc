all the documentation should only include the essense, 
and leave away all the blabber like "Implementation Benefits, Summary, etc..".
the developers of this repo are all operating with LLM copilots so keep it minimalistic, short and concise. 
Aim for 20-30 lines maximum on most docs. 80% content reduction from verbose versions. (follow the 20/80 rule)

## What to Include
- **Core technical facts only**
- **Code examples with minimal explanation**
- **Essential "how it works" information**

## What to Remove
- Salesy language (you are not convincing an investor, chillax)
- Redundant explanations
- Sections like "Benefits", "Summary"
- Verbose introductions
- Step-by-step tutorials (unless critical)
- Bullet point lists with obvious information

## Example:

## Notes:

aim to reuse existing docs if they have close meaning (modify them) instead of creating new files. of course where makes sense - create a new file instead.
