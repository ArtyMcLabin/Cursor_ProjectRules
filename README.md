# Cursor Project Rules

Pick any that fit you and put in your folder. those are the common ones that i use in most of my projects (selectively still).

they are all tweaked to be generic and dont include project specific stuff.
note: some of them are intended to be auto-included, some are to be manually called. for example use "@release-the-kraken.mdc" explicitly as attachment or embedding in your chat, to trigger the furious YOLO mode. same with @qa.mdc etc
